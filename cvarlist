allow_spectators	1	0	1	boolean				server	Allows players to join as spectator.
ati_npatch	1	0	1	boolean				video	Enables ATI's TRUform technology, this will result in higher quality models but will decrease performance.
ati_subdiv	2	0	7	integer				video	This is the ATI TRUform level, the higher you go (with ati_npatch set to 1) the more polygons are added to the models to smooth them out
bgmbuffer	4096			integer				audio	Sets the allocated memory for CD/MP3 music in kB.
bgmvolume	1	0	1	boolean				sound	When disabled, it pauses the current sound which is being played with "mp3" or "cd" command. To unpause, just reenable.
bottomcolor	0	0	255	integer				video	Sets the bottom color of your model in Half-Life that others see.
brightness	1	0	2	integer				video	Sets the brightness value.
cam_command	0	0	1	boolean				cheat	Enable Third Person. It's the same as the command "thirdperson". In HL, it doesn't need sv_cheats 1 to work.
cam_contain	0			boolean				cheat	
cam_idealdist	64			float				cheat	The distance of the camera in third person. See cam_command.
cam_idealpitch	0			float				cheat	The pitch of the third person camera. See cam_command.
cam_idealyaw	90			float				cheat	The yaw of the third person camera. See cam_command.
cam_snapto	0	0	1	boolean				cheat	If enabled, your view angles will move as the same speed as your movements instead of moving your view angles faster than your movements. Only in third person. See cam_command.
chase_active	0	0	1	boolean				camera	This is thirdperson, like cam_command 1, except that it only works in single player and when you move your mouse, it is like zooming in your player model.
chase_back	100			float				camera	It sets how far the camera is behind you when chase_active is 1.
chase_right	0			float				camera	It sets how far the camera is at your right you when chase_active is 1.
If you want to make the camera at your left, use negative values.
 		chase_up	16			float				camera	It sets how far the camera is above you when chase_active is 1.
 		clientport	27005			string				connection	Sets the port that the client connects to the server through.
 		clockwindow	0.5			float				server	It's designed to combat the speedhacks being used in-game. The default value for this cvar is "0.5". As you lower the value (0.3, 0.1, 0.01, etc.), modem clients' games should feel jittery. Adjusting "clockwindow" does not affect the server. This doesn't really block the speedhacks now, but just make the speedhacker lag a lot when speedhacking.
 		cl_allowdownload	1	0	1	boolean				connection	Allow maps, models, sounds, sprites, textures download when connecting to a server.
 		cl_allowupload	1	0	1	boolean				connection	Allow the upload of your custom spray when connecting to a server.
 		cl_anglespeedkey	0.67			float				movement	It defines the turning speed ratio with +left/+right while walking (+speed). cl_yawspeed * cl_anglespeedkey = turning speed while walking. By default the turning speed while walking is 140.7(210 * 0.67 = 140.7)
 		cl_backspeed	400			integer				movement	Sets the speed using the backward key (+back). This is limited by sv_maxspeed server side. And in CS this is limited by the per weapon speed. This should be equal to cl_forward and cl_sidespeed or you will have problem holding forward and left at the same time for example.
 		cl_bob	0.01	0	1	float				video	Sets the amount that the view bobs while the player is running.
 		cl_bobcycle	0.8			float				video	Sets how frequent the player's view bobs while running. I would recommend leaving this at the default value, since it messes up your hands since an update(it's like zooming on them). Before this update it messed up your crosshair. Has no effect when cl_bob is 0.
 		cl_bobup	0.5			float				video	Sets the amount the player bobs up while running. Has no effect when cl_bob is 0.
 		cl_chasedist	112			integer				camera	It modifies how far the camera is zoomed out whilst your dead.
 		cl_clockreset	0.1			float				netcode	If the client clock drifts more than cl_clockreset from the server, we just slam it to use the server and reset the delta to 0 – usually occurs at signon to server and maybe if there is a lot of packet loss.
 		cl_cmdbackup	2			integer				netcode	In addition, with each command packets(cl_cmdrate), we re-send the last few previous movement commands ( in case there is packet loss ) so that we can keep moving smoothly in the face of minor network problems. The default number of "backup" commands that we send is 2, but you can change this number by setting cl_cmdbackup to another number. You can send more than 8 backup commands and you should note that sending backup commands will increase your outgoing bandwidth usage.
 		cl_cmdrate	30	10		integer				netcode	This is the maximum of command packets you will send to the server per second. The default is to send up to 30 command packets per second up to the server. If you are running faster than 30 frames per second, then multiple commands will be put into some packets. You can change the rate of sending command packets to the server by setting the cl_cmdrate cvar.
 		cl_corpsestay	600			integer				video	Time in seconds before dead bodies dissapears from the ground.
 		cl_crosshair_color	50 250 50			string				interface	Defines the color of the crosshair in RGB, the value must be encased in double quotes.
 		cl_crosshair_size	0/auto			string				interface	Defines the size of your crosshair. The different values are : 0 or auto / 1 or small / 2 or medium / 3 or large.
 		cl_crosshair_translucent		0	1	boolean				interface	Enables translucent crosshair.
 		cl_dlmax	128	16	1024	integer				netcode	Cl_dlmax determines the “fragment” size for chunks of player decals, etc. that are downloaded while playing the game. Clamped to 16 to 1024 bytes. Useful to try and limit decals from taking up a lot of bandwidth – this made a lot more sense back when everyone was on 14.4 kbps modems.
 		cl_download_ingame	1	0	1	boolean				connection	Enables the download of players custom sprays while playing.
 		cl_dynamiccrosshair	1	0	1	boolean				interface	Enables the dynamic crosshair when crouching/jumping...
 		cl_fixtimerate	7.5			float				netcode	Cl_fixtimerate is the # of msec per frame of “clock drift” fixup. Since the server is sending timestamps in every packet, but we only read networking once per frame, we don’t want to just “accept” the server clock, so we use it as a target and “correct” toward it by the fixtimerate (unless the delta becomes too large and we snap the client to the server clock).
 		cl_fog_b	0	0	255	integer				video	It sets the fog color blue value. Fog can be enabled with gl_fog 1. By default, this CVar is hidden and you need to add -dev to the game command line for this cvar to work. The only official map that have fog is de_inferno_cz. Map authors can add fog in their maps with the env_fog entity which auto set this CVar.
 		cl_fog_density	0	0	1	float				video	It sets the density of the fog. Fog can be enabled with gl_fog 1. By default, this CVar is hidden and you need to add -dev to the game command line for this cvar to work. The only official map that have fog is de_inferno_cz. Map authors can add fog in their maps with the env_fog entity which auto set this CVar. A good value is 0.0003.
 		cl_fog_g	0	0	255	integer				video	It sets the fog color green value. Fog can be enabled with gl_fog 1. By default, this CVar is hidden and you need to add -dev to the game command line for this cvar to work. The only official map that have fog is de_inferno_cz. Map authors can add fog in their maps with the env_fog entity which auto set this CVar.
 		cl_fog_r	0	0	255	integer				video	It sets the fog color red value. Fog can be enabled with gl_fog 1. By default, this CVar is hidden and you need to add -dev to the game command line for this cvar to work. The only official map that have fog is de_inferno_cz. Map authors can add fog in their maps with the env_fog entity which auto set this CVar.
 		cl_forwardspeed	400			integer				movement	Sets the speed using the forward key (+forward). This is limited by sv_maxspeed server side. And in CS this is limited by the per weapon speed.This should be equal to cl_backspeed and cl_sidespeed or you will have problem holding forward and left at the same time for example.
 		cl_gaitestimation	1	0	1	boolean				netcode	Cl_gaitestimation uses an alternate path for computing the velocity of other players, which is used to drive their lower body (leg) animations. However, cs 1.6 forces it on and the cvar is ignored.
 		cl_gg	0	0	1	boolean				server	If enables, when viewing a demo with using playdemo or viewdemo, it runs the demo in benchmaking mode, quits the game and saves the results in fps.txt file . It's the same as running a demo with gg "demoname".
 		cl_himodels	0	0	1	boolean				video	Enables the High Quality models. This only works in Half-Life.
 		cl_idealpitchscale	0.8			float				video	This was used by a system (mostly for using joysticks) of adjusting the eye “pitch” angle when walking up/down sloped surfaces. It looks like this used to “scale” how quickly the pitch converged on the “ideal” pitch for the slope. This works when lookspring is enabled (mouse look need to be disabled) and when joystick look is enabled. The value is by how many degree the view is adjusted when walking up/down sloped surfaces.
 		cl_lc	1	0	1	boolean				netcode	This is called "server-side hit computation and lag compensation".
This only works if the server is allowing lag compensation (sv_unlag 1) and if the firing player is requesting lag compensation (cl_lc 1 - note that the player must also be predicting weapon firing client-side, too, or cl_lc is ignored). Don't change this. See also cl_lw.
 		cl_logocolor	#Valve_Orange			string				interface	It defines the color of your spray: #Valve_Blue, #Valve_Brown, #Valve_Dkgray, #Valve_Ltblue, #Valve_Ltgray, #Valve_Green, #Valve_Orange, #Valve_Red, #Valve_Yellow
 		cl_logofile	lambda			string				interface	It defines which spray you want to use among those: 8ball1, andre, camp1, chick1, chuckskull, devl1, gun1, lambda, skull, smiley, splatt, tiki, v_1
 		cl_lw	1	0	1	boolean				netcode	This is called "client-side weapon firing prediction".
What this refers to is the instantaneous set of effects that occur when the fire button is pressed. These effects are all done client-side if client-side weapon firing prediction is enabled (cl_lw is 1). The effects include: starting the weapon firing animation, showing any muzzle flash, creating any ejected shells, drawing decals and bullet puffs at the impact spot on the wall of the level, starting the weapon firing sound, etc. However, the actual determination of whether the shot (for hit-scan weapons at least) hit another player is now and always has been done at the server. If this is disabled, Lag Compensation is also disabled. See cl_lc.
 		cl_minmodels	0	0	1	boolean				video	Enable displaying of only the minimum models: leet.mdl, gign.mdl and vip.mdl, enabling may improve performance.
 		cl_movespeedkey	0.52	0	0.52	float				movement	The speed at which you move when +speed is active.
 		cl_needinstanced	0	0	1	boolean				developer	Enabling this will print into the console some infos about the models being loaded(weapon models). You need developer 1 to see the infos. And you need sv_instancedbaseline 1 server side. (This is already 1 by default)
 		cl_nosmooth	0	0	1	boolean				netcode	It defines if the prediction errors will be smoothly corrected over the cl_smoothtime time. If set to 1, the prediction error smoothing is disabled (same with cl_smoothime 0).
 		cl_observercrosshair	1	0	1	boolean				interface	This enables the crosshair in Free Look spectator mode. It's buggued, it only works if you die and the camera is set to free look, after changing spectating mode, it will not work except next round if you die and are in free look mode again.
 		cl_pitchdown	89			integer				interface	Sets the maximum view angle to look down. This is locked and can't be changed in CS.
 		cl_pitchspeed	225	50		float				movement	This is how fast your view loop up / look down with using the commands +lookup / +lookdown.
 		cl_pitchup	89			integer				interface	Sets the maximum view angle to look up. This is locked and can't be changed in CS.
 		cl_pmanstats	0	0	1	boolean				interface	It displays on your screen infos about particles. The particles are smokes grenades (maybe there are others things, but I didn't see anything other that could change this particle meter).
"Number of particles" is the number of particles that are in the map at the moment.
"Particles Drawn" is how much particles are drawn on your screen at the moment.
"CMiniMem Free" is how much memory is availaible for smokes.
 		cl_radartype	0	0	1	boolean				interface	Enables opaque (non translucent) radar.
 		cl_rate	9999	1000	20000	integer				netcode	This is how many bytes per seconds the client send to the server. Note: It's a command but it works like a cvar, except that sometimes it doesn't work if you try setting it in your cfg.
 		cl_resend	6	1.5	20	float				connection	Delay in seconds before the client will resend the 'connect' attempt. This is when you have problem connecting to server and when you see : "Retrying connection to server #1". And this hasn't anything to do with netcode like people originally though.
 		cl_righthand	1	-1	1	integer				interface	If it's set to -1, you'll have your guns on left hand and your knife on right hand. If it's set to 0, all weapons are on left hand. If it's set to 1, all weapons are on right hand.
 		cl_shadows	1	0	1	boolean				video	Enables player shadows (small black circle), disable to improve performance.
 		cl_showerror	0	0	1	boolean				interface	Show the Prediction Errors on your screen.
 		cl_showevents	0	0	1	boolean				interface	Enables showing on events like weapon firing, all events are listed in cstrike/events/.
 		cl_showfps	0	0	1	boolean				interface	Shows your current FPS in the upper left corner of your screen.
 		cl_showmessages	0	0	1	boolean				interface	Dump network traffic to console. It needs developer 1 to work.
 		cl_shownet	0	0	2	integer				netcode	0 Do not display any information.
1 Print current incoming packet size in byte.
2 Print information about the current in coming packet and it's size.
 		cl_sidespeed	400			integer				movement	Sets the speed using the move left and move right key (+moveleft and +moveright). This is limited by sv_maxspeed server side. And in CS this is limited by the per weapon speed. This should be equal to cl_backspeed and cl_forwardspeed or you will have problem holding forward and left at the same time for example.
 		cl_slist	10			integer				connection	This is how many seconds to wait max for responses when doing a LAN “slist” ping. Responses coming in later than that are ignored.
 		cl_smoothtime	0.1			float				netcode	It defines the amount of time the view will be smoothly correct after a prediction error. If we set cl_smoothtime to 0 (or cl_nosmooth to 1), our interpolation wont be 'smoothed' or corrected and we will see the actual position of the players. Note that this will cause a jump in the players movements, but they will be correct.
 		cl_solid_players	1	0	1	boolean				netcode	Whether the movement prediction engine should treat other players as solid.
 		cl_timeout	300			integer				connection	When you are inactive, it's after how many seconds the server disconnect you. This is also controled by sv_timeout (server side)
 		cl_updaterate	20	10	102	integer				netcode	It's the number of updates per second you are requesting from the server.
 		cl_upspeed	320			integer				movement	Sets the speed using the swim up / swim down keys(+moveup / +moveleft). This is limited by sv_maxspeed server side. And in CS this is limited by the per weapon speed.
 		cl_vsmoothing	0.05	0.0		float				netcode	This is called "View smoothing", enables interpolation between view vectors. It smooths/interpolates the view origin and angles when riding trains/plats. 0.05 should be good(if you have above 20 fps) and 0 disables it so it should increase your fps.
 		cl_waterdist	4			integer				interface	It compensates the view along the surface of water.
 		cl_weaponlistfix	0	0	1	boolean				netcode	It was to fix a bug in the original HL1 code related to the WeaponList usermessage – the message would just be ignored if this was set.
 		cl_weather	1	0	3	integer				video	Enables rain on de_aztec, 1 will cause a few rain drops, 2 will increase them, and 3 will cause a downpour.

Disables it to improve performance.
 		cl_yawspeed	210	0		float				movement	Defines turn speed with +left and +right.
 		com_filewarning	0			 				 	
 		console	1	0	1	boolean				interface	This is not working in Steam, but in Won (the system before Steam) if you had this CVar on "0" you couldn't open the console.
 		con_color	255 180 30			string				interface	Sets the color of chat messages. in RGB. In Won (the system before Steam), it was used to change the console text color as well.
 		con_fastmode				 				 	
 		con_notifytime	4	0		integer				interface	The amount of time in seconds developer messages stay in the upper-left before disappear of the screen.
 		coop	0	0	1	boolean				server	This was to enable the cooperative mode in Quake. This is not working in HL1 because there is NO coop mod (not working in CS either because CS is multi player).
 		crosshair	1	0	1	boolean				video	Enables the red dot at the middle of awp/scout/g3sg1/sg550 crosshairs.
 		c_maxdistance	200			float				cheat	This is the maximum distance of the camera in third person (see cam_command) using +camdistance (cmd).
 		c_maxpitch	90			float				cheat	This is the maximum pitch of the camera in third person (see cam_command) using +cammousemove (cmd).
 		c_maxyaw	135			float				cheat	This is the maximum yaw of the camera in third person (see cam_command) using +cammousemove (cmd).
 		c_mindistance	30			float				cheat	This is the minimum distance of the camera in third person (see cam_command) using +camdistance (cmd).
 		c_minyaw	-135			float				cheat	This is the minimum yaw of the camera in third person (see cam_command) using +cammousemove (cmd).
 		deathmatch	0	0	1	boolean				server	It defines if the server is multi player (1) or single player (0). When you launch a listen or dedicated server, this is auto set to 1. This only stay on 0 if you launch a map by map "mapname" or you play HL single player.
 		decalfrequency	30	0		integer				server	Sets the frequency at which players can spray their logos. Amount is in seconds, 0 means no delay (spray as fast as you can).
 		default_fov	90	10	150	integer				interface	Sets the field of view in Half-Life. In CS changing it only takes effect when zoomed out over your body in spectator mode after you die. Also this will mess with your sensitivity if you try to adjust it. In Half-Life this could be used to get a "zoom" effect even for a gun without a scope
 		developer	0	0	2	integer				interface	Enables developer mode. Developer mode can be used to show information on screen and prints advanced informations into console. Developer 2 gives more advanced informations than developer 1.
 		dev_overview	0	0	1	boolean				cheat	It shows the overview map created by the game. Used for mappers, to get overview image.
 		direct	0.9	0.75	1.0	float				video	Determines scaling of ambient/direct lighting on studio models.
 		displaysoundlist	0	0	1	boolean				server	If set, this shows the AI sound list to the console (only with developer 2).
 		d_mipcap	0	0	3	integer				video	It sets a maximum quality for all textures, close or far.
0 High texture detail.
1 Medium texture detail.
2 Low texture detail.
3 Minimum texture detail.
 		d_mipscale	1			integer				video	It sets the maximum scaled quality of distant textures.

0 Full object detail
1 Some object detail
2 Medium object detail
3 Low object detail

And i think you can go over 3.
 		d_spriteskip	0	0	1	boolean				video	It enables fast sprites rendering. It will skip rendering every N scanlines.
 		edgefriction	2			integer				server	This is used to add slowdown when jumping off of an edge. When jumping off of a platform that is 70 units from the ground, the effect of edgefriction is greatly increased. When set higher, the force pulling you down is greater. (Gravity in a sense)
 		ex_interp	0.1	0.009	0.1	integer				netcode	ex_interp sets the amount of time (in seconds) to interpolate in between each successive update(cl_updaterate).
Set this variable to 0 and nothing else. Counter-Strike will automatically set your ex_interp to 1/cl_updaterate (i.e. your console will say: "ex_interp forced up to xx msec"). This is because the time in between each packet is exactly 1/(the # of updates per second), so this is how long you want your client to interpolate.
 		fakelag	0			integer				cheat	Simulates lag when the value is higher than 0. Higher value is more lag.
 		fakeloss	0			integer				cheat	Simulates loss when the value is higher than 0. Higher value is more loss, sv_cheats must be enabled for this to work.
 		fastsprites	1	0	2	integer				video	Defines quality of smokepuffs, 0 being the worst and 2 being the best. Set to lower quality to improve performance.
 		fps_max	72	20	1000	float				video	Set the maximum frames per second. You can only have over 100 if developer is 1 (on).
 		fps_modem	0	20	100	float				video	This is the old fps_max CVar for Internet. Leave this at 0 and use fps_max.
 		fs_lazy_precache	0	0	1	boolean				connection	Normally this toggle is disabled which in turn enables the game to load all of the necessary sound files for that specific map before the game starts. If this toggle is enabled the game will not preload the sound files during the start of the map, instead the sound files will only be loaded when they are necessary. The sound files will stay in memory after they are loaded in order to increase performance of the game by not having to reload the same sound files from the hard drive every time that the sound file is used.
 		fs_perf_warnings	0	0	1	boolean				developer	Controls printing of warnings about texture resampling. It needs developer to be 1 (On).
 		fs_precache_timings	0	0	1	boolean				developer	Perf printouts about sound and model loading. It needs developer to be 1 (On).
 		fs_startup_timings	0	0	1	boolean				developer	Controls a bunch of console spew about timings at startup time for the engine. It needs developer to be 1 (On).
 		gamma	2.5	1.8	3	float				video	Sets the gamma value.
 		gl_affinemodels	0	1	0	boolean				video	Applies opengl perspective correction hints: e.g.: glHint (GL_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTION_HINT, GL_NICEST);
 		gl_alphamin	0.25			boolean				video	This controls how filtering of alpha-masked textures (gratings, fences, screen-door stuff) affects the appearance of edges. Higher values makes these items (i.e. the gratings,fences,etc.) look "skinnier", 1 makes them absolutely disappear.
 		gl_clear	0	0	1	boolean				video	If you enable gl_clear, it will clear the color-buffer. Basically, this means that when the camera can see into the void, either because of the map extending past the farclip plane or there is some kind of corruption of the map data. This is often used as a debugging tool as the 'gl_clear' color is red. It's used by Mappers to see if there are leaks in their maps. It seems that in D3D, it turns everything to red even if you are not outside the map.
 		gl_cull	1	0	1	boolean				video	Enables opengl GL_CULL_FACE setting.
 		gl_d3dflip	0	0	1	boolean				video	This CVar have only a effect in D3D mode. It enable reversed rendering order. With nVidia Detonator 53.03 and gl_d3dflip 0, you can get a WH.
If you are having mouse lags problems in D3D( most of time in smokes ), you can try gl_d3dflip 1, it will reduce the lag or fix it.
 		gl_dither	1	0	1	boolean				video	16 bit OpenGL rendering can use a form of dithering where the lack of colour depth is hidden by rounding different ways depending on the pixel being drawn. Setting to 0 can theoretically be faster or less hideous. Then again, it could look more bland. It depends on personal preference. It seems that at 32 bit it don't have effect on walls but only on sky.
 		gl_flipmatrix	0	0	1	boolean				video	It's a fix for your crosshair if you are using 3dfx drivers (Old video cards, example: Voodoo, Voodoo2, Rush or Banshee.) Maybe in CS 1.6 you can't even use 3dfx servers since there is no option like in 1.5 to enable it. If you use that with others drivers you'll get your AWP/Scout crosshair buggued.
 		gl_fog	1	0	1	boolean				video	Turn On/Off the fog effect. This was made for CZ and not for 1.6 but it can work in 1.6. It only works in de_inferno_cz. But with this you can get a colored map (or make it work in all maps) : You must have -dev in the launch parameters and set cl_fog_density to 1 + cl_fog_r/cl_fog_r/cl_fog_g (those control the color).
 		gl_keeptjunctions	1	0	1	boolean				video	Keep collinear points added by QCSG/QBSP to fix T-junctions. If you set it to 0 you will see cracks between some textures.
 		gl_lightholes	1	0	1	boolean				video	Controls whether to apply lighting to surfaces with “holes” (not sure if this still actually works).
 		gl_max_size	512	256	512	integer				video	The maximum pixel size which textures are loaded in. The value must be a multiple of 16 to prevent white textures, when a texture is larger than gl_max_size it will be cropped into that size, if that size isn't a multiple of 16 it will become a white texture. Although gl_max_size has no maximum value, a value of 512 is the most realistic maximum value of gl_max_size.
 		gl_monolights	0	0	1	boolean				video	Create uniform light source, no shadows. (Can also be called FullBright). When a grenade explode in a area or you turn on your flashlight, the gamma of this area will go back to normal.
 		gl_nobind	0	0	1	boolean				video	Toggles the replacement of textures with alphanumeric characters. Obsolete, not working in 1.6.
 		gl_nocolors	0	0	1	boolean				video	Don't bind separately colored textures for players. Obsolete and not supported.
 		gl_overbright	0	0	1	boolean				video	Saturated lighting. Makes lighting more natural and realistic.
 		gl_palette_tex	1	0	1	boolean				video	Enable/disable support for paletted textures. If the GL driver you're using doesn't support the extension, this won't make any difference. But some cards support the extension poorly and support must be disabled using this variable.
 		gl_picmip	0	0	3	integer				video	Sets the rendering quality - * higher the number is faster but lower quality
Don't set it over 3 or cs will crash.
 		gl_playermip	0	0	1	boolean				video	Sets the rendering quality to the models. Not supported.
 		gl_polyoffset	0.1/4	-0.001	25	integer				video	Amount of offset to apply to decals on polygons.
 		gl_reporttjunctions	0	0	1	boolean				video	This cvar doesn't have any effect.
 		gl_round_down	3	0	5	integer				video	This is the textures accuracy or the textures rounding. When textures need to be resized they are rounded up or down depending of this. Setting it to a low value SHOULD make the textures rendered more accurately and setting it to a high value SHOULD make the textures accuracy worse. I say "SHOULD" because it can depend of video card. The max value SHOULD be 5 but again it can depend of video card.
 		gl_spriteblend	1	0	1	boolean				video	It enabled alpha-blending on sprites. It's like the rendering quality to the sprites (gl_spriteblend 0 = bad quality), blood n stuffs.(0=more blood)
 		gl_wateramp	0.3			float				video	It amplifies the water's waves (in maps with water of course). This cvar can only be changed by sv_wateramp(Server Side).
 		gl_wireframe	0	0	3	integer				video	gl_wireframe 1 does the former, placing glowing lines on each face that the engine is drawing which show how it is being split up. gl_wireframe 2 does the same thing, but the lines it creates can be seen through walls, thus allowing you to tell how much of the map is being drawn (including other areas that maybe should not be drawn!).

gl_wireframe 1, then, is good for seeing how faces are being split etc. gl_wireframe 2 is best for seeing if your VIS blockers are actually working and stopping other areas from being drawn.

This is used by mappers to see what is calculated to improve the performances of their maps.

Mappers can set the value they want in their map (with the worldspawn entity) and it automatically changes this cvar on map load. It changes the value of gl_zmax of any client who connects to the server. VALVe added this cvar because with gl_zmax 0 you could see through walls (in D3D renderer), so client is forced to use the server's value and can't modify gl_zmax.
